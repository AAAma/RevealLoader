## Reveal iOS Jailbreak Tweak 
Reveal Loader dynamically loads libReveal.dylib (Reveal.app support) into iOS apps on jailbroken devices. Configuration is via the Reveal menu in Settings.app

Reveal is an OS X application that allows you to remotely introspect a running applications view hierarchy and edit various view properties. 

Generally you have to include their debugging framework in your application at build time in-order to perform debugging actions, however with this tweak installed this is no longer necessary.
